# Contributing

I got stuck with an issue with the fleet of aliens. The code that I had written has the aliens check the screen edges incorrectly and they would race straight down to the bottom, causing the game to be unplayable. I reached out to my small network of coders to get help and we were still not able to fix the problem. So, I reached out to Eric Matthes, the author of the book and in a days time, he was able to send me back a couple questions to get me thinking more critically about what was written and then I was finally able to overcome the issue and squash that bug!

Thanks Eric!
